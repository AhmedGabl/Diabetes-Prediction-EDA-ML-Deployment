# **Diabetes Predictor App**  
🚀 *Predict the likelihood of diabetes with a simple, interactive web app powered by Machine Learning!*  

### **Overview**  
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key health metrics. The app uses a trained Random Forest model, scaled data inputs, and provides real-time predictions.
